TODO: **Achievement 2 - Before and After**

- X Declare a variable with a name of your choice

- Assign this variable a value of your choice
  - String
  - Number
  - Boolean
  - Array

- Print the variable (Before) with `console.log.`

- Print the variable again (After), but changed in some way, such as
  - concatenate a String using template literals
  - increment a Number with the increment operator (++)
  - Reverse a Boolean value with the logical NOT (!) operator
  - Output the number of items in an array with Array.length

  So far I've declared a few variables. Am playing around with the console to understand what it does a bit better. 

  Watched a video to better understand variables. [7: How to Create Variables in JavaScript](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aGIAL16DL4&t=361s) by Dani Krossing 

  This activity has actually really helped to visialize some of the things that one is able to do with JavaScript. 

  Been using plenty of Youtube videos to help. Will link underneath.
