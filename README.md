TODO: **Achievement 2 - Before and After**

- X Declare a variable with a name of your choice

- Assign this variable a value of your choice
  - String
  - Number
  - Boolean
  - Array

- Print the variable (Before) with `console.log.`

- Print the variable again (After), but changed in some way, such as
  - concatenate a String using template literals
  - increment a Number with the increment operator (++)
  - Reverse a Boolean value with the logical NOT (!) operator
  - Output the number of items in an array with Array.length

  So far I've declared a few variables. Am playing around with the console to understand what it does a bit better. 

  Watched a video to better understand variables. [7: How to Create Variables in JavaScript](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aGIAL16DL4&t=361s) by Dani Krossing
